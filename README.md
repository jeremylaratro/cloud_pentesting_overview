# Cloud Pentesting: A Resource Meta-Collection

I recently started getting into the world of cloud pentesting and wanted to put together some resources for a good starting point for beginners. This is essentially a huge list of other resources - compilations, provider-specifics, labs, tools, and more - all in one place. This is by no means comprehensive, and I will continue to update this as I find more resources. Please feel free to suggest resources to add, or add them and make a PR.   

## Overview
> Common Technologies

Some of the many cloud providers. AWS is a good place to start, and kubernetes is interesting as well. 
- AWS
- GCP
- Azure
- Kubernetes
- IBM
- Digital Ocean

>- Major topics to know:
- 	IAM Policies
- 	S3 Buckets
- 	EC2 Instances
- 	lambda functions & API endpoints
- 	VPC	
- 	Group and Managed policies


- Find ssh keys --> use 'aws s3 cp' to get ssh key 
- SSRF
- RCE 
-  instance-profile-attachment
	-  have low or insufficient privileges, but this permission - can create a new EC2 instance with much high privileges than can be further exploited

- #### Setting up your first AWS lab - a high level overview:	  
	- Make AWS account
	- Go to IAM and create a user or users and group(s) with the proper permissions/policies - depends on the lab, but for cloudgoat these work: (AdministratorAccess, AmazonRDSFullAccess, IAMFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, CloudWatchFullAccess, AmazonDynamoDBFullAcces)
	- Go to S3 and ensure you can create buckets
	- configure your AWS account locally with the aws cli, using the account ID, secret, and region that you obtained when creatng the IAM roles
	- It may be necessary to enable ACLs, which can be done through the S3 bucket permissions
